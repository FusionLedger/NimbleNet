# AeonNet
AeonNet is a Trading Time Value Tokenisation Platform deployed on Aeternity Application Architecture with Smart Contracts written on Sophia, a functonal programming language. It is designed as a decentralised application where traders can sell their expertise to novice traders. Time Trade Tokenss are built with NFT standards. All time locks are aggregated using ECDSA basd elliptical curve cryptographic security with a Hash Time Locked Contract (HTLC) for verification purpose.  

## Summary
- Decentralised Trading Time Tokens Powered by Aeternity Architecture based Hash Time Locked Contracts (HTLC). 

## Concept
- Options trading is the trading of instruments that gives the right to buy or sell a specific security on a specific date at a specific price.
- Time value refers to the portion of an option's premium that is attributable to the amount of time remaining until the expiration of the option contract. 
- The premium of any option consists of two components: its intrinsic value and its time value.
- Time Value is also considered as an extrinsic or instrumental value in the options trading context. 
- It is the premium a rational investor would pay over its current exercise value (intrinsic value).
- It is based on the probability that it will increase in value before expiry. 
- This value is always greater than zero in a fair market, thus an option is always worth more than its current exercise value. 
- Time value decays to zero at expiration, with a rule that it will lose ​1⁄3 of its value during the first half of its life and ​2⁄3 in the second half.

## Components
- Hash Time Locks implemented through the Time Stamping Transactions in a Blockchain
- Time Value Token created as a Non Fungible Token in the Aeternity Token Standard
- Time Value Aggregation using Time Lock Properties such as Sequence, Route and Order

## Tools
- Aeternity Node
- Aeternity Smart Contracts
- Aeternity SDK
- NodeJS
- NPM

## What is next
- Options Premium stored in the Multi Signature Wallet
